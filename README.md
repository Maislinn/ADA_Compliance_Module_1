## Short Decription: 
- USER STORY: AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: 
- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

- What did you learn?
   - I understand Semantic HTML and what this entails when adjusting repos, I also understand the importance of optimizing documents for readability and usability for both customer and client. 

## Installation

- Cloned Urban-Octo-Telegram repo from GitHub using my SSH Key, Code provided by UC Berkeley instructors, October 2022. Included in this repo was already populated css, html and image assets. I did not originate this code. My updates are fairloy well documents in comments throughout the repo.

## Usage

- This website can be used to highlight the work client "Horiseo" is offering: SEO, Online Reputation Management, social media marketing. This website allows clients and potential clients to navigate easily to the information they desire with clear visuals. Alt's are added to images to improve SEO, and meet ADA compliance standards.

- You will see alt added to images such as the example on line 44 in ![Example](assets/images/ScreenShot1.png)
